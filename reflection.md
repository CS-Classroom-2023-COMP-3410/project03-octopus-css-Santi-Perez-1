## Reflection

My main goal was to make the webpage look as close to the screenshot as possible using CSS. At first my page looked really plain, so I focused on the biggest things that stood out in the screenshot, like the blue header, the white content area, and the light blue quiz box.

One of the hardest parts was getting the quiz section to look right as the screenshot showed the quiz inside a box and the octopus image on the right side. I fixed this by adding CSS to float the image to the right and adding spacing so the text and inputs didn’t overlap or look messy. I also added a border around the image to make it look more like the screenshot.

Making the table look right was also tricky. I changed the table borders, made the header row a darker gray color, and adjusted the spacing inside each table cell. This helped it look more similar to the example. I also used padding and margins in a lot of places to make the page feel more squished together.

Matching a screenshot takes a lot of small changes, not just one big CSS rule. I also learned how useful it can be to use background colors, spacing, and font styling to make a webpage look more organized and professional. If I had more time, I would try to make the spacing and font sizes even more exact, but I think my final version is close enough to the screenshot.
